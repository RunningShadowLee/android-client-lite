## Updates
We've got some neat stuff in store for Sentinel Lite users. **This build is currently in its testing phase.**

### All new Interface and Features
General usability is a priority. We have a ton of improvements, both visually and in subtler ways. The client runs smoother on a wider variety of devices, providing the user with a seamless experience.

### Broad Geographical Selection
Nodes are sorted and accessible by continent. Sorting options are in place to further filter nodes by Country, Bandwidth, Rating and more. Continents with no nodes are hidden by default.

### Hassle-free Quick Connect
One-tap connect to a random node. This presents a natural solution to offset sorting biases that cause users to overload nodes with higher visibility, thus evenly distribute traffic between all nodes. In the future we will move to latency based quick connect, which will work in tandem with the prospective node health indicator.

### Interaction-free
Skip the interaction. You can now automatically initiate "quick connect" on app launch.

**That's all folks. Happy testing!**
